Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the department of [Data Science and AI](https://www.monash.edu/it/dsai) at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu). Before going to Monash, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the PRaDA (Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics) center (now the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute ([A²I²](https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au) ) at [Deakin University](https://www.deakin.edu.au).

I was a Ph.D. student in PRaDA center at Deakin University from 2013 to early 2017. I worked under the supervision of [Professor Dinh Phung](http://dinhphung.ml)  and [Professor Svetha Venkatesh](https://svethav.github.io). My [Ph.D. work](http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30103238/huynh-towardsscalable-2017.pdf) focused on resorting big data to actionable information involves dealing with four dimensions of challenges in big data (called four V’s): volume, variety, velocity, veracity. In this research project, I sought for novel Bayesian nonparametric models and scalable learning algorithms which can deal with these challenges of the big data era. I also earned my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in computer science in 2005 and 2009 respectively, all of which were completed at University of Technology, Vietnam.

Current Research Interests
